# WeatherOPT
Project of Weather station, based at OrangePI One.

I am using Bosh BME280 sensor. It can measure temperature, humidity and pressure. Sensor has i2s bus, so i will work with it as i2c-slawe


There are also very simple Telegram Bot, that can be runned at the orangePi. It can send you mesurements, taken fron Bosh sensor, once per minute. Still have a lot of things, I want to to add to this bot.
