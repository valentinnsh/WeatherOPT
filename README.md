Project of Weather station, based at OrangePI One.

I am using Bosh BME280 sensor. It can measure temperature, hunidity and pressure. Sensor has i2s bus, so i will work with it as i2c-slawe

Also, I want am writing Telegram-bot, that can call measureations and send message with result. Bot will be written, using python.
